IndiGameStop is my defense project for Python Web course at SoftUni. This is a project that I've always wanted to make and I'm happy I got around to creating it.

IndiGameStop is a social media site in which you can post some information about your projects as a game developer. You can write posts add comments and many more things. I hope you will like it as much as i liked creating it.
